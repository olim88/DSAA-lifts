# Real Time Lift simulation in python
this project uses a modular system to create multiple algorithms for lifts. These algorithms can be run through a real time simulation and there statistics can be compaired on a graph

# How to run
1. download repository
2. `pip install requirements.txt`
3. run `python main.py` to start the TUI form here you can control the whole program

# How to use
once `main.py` is running you can either:
1. create a new random simulation based on inputed constraints floors ect
2. you can run the created simulation with or without a gui showing it happening in real time
3. you can view the statistics form a given simulation and compare them to other simulation
4. tooggle logging to show more indepth happenings of the simulation running without its GUI
